# Module Summary

Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know: 

- Backend technologies include various types of servers and supporting infrastructures such as programming languages, frameworks, and other hardware.  
    
- Node.js is the server-side component of JavaScript. 
    
- The require statement can be called from anywhere in the app code, is bound dynamically, and is synchronous. The import statement must be called at the beginning of a file, is bound statically, and is not asynchronous.
    
- Client-side JavaScript is used to process front-end user interface elements, and server-side JavaScript is used to enable access to different kinds of servers and web applications. 
    
- With server-side JavaScript, Node.js applications process and route web service requests from the client. 
    
- To make a function or a value available to Node.js applications that import your module, add a property to the implicit exports object. 
    
- Core modules include bare minimum functionality, local modules are those that you create for your application, and the Node.js community creates third-party modules.
    
- A local install means only the application within the directory of the installed can access the package, whereas a global install means that any application on the machine can access the package.
