Below is the English translation of the Angular Junior Developer roadmap based on Angular v19, incorporating updates from angular.dev and the key features of Angular 19:

---

### 1. Basic Web Technologies

- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:**
    - Semantic HTML, responsive design (using CSS Flexbox, Grid)
    - ES6+ syntax and DOM manipulation
- **TypeScript:**
    - Types, interfaces, generics, and classes
    - Asynchronous programming (Promises, async/await)

---

### 2. Angular CLI and Project Initialization

- **Angular CLI:**
    - Generating projects, creating components, services, and directives via scaffolding
    - Configuring projects and updating versions using Angular CLI (ng update)
- **Angular.dev Resources:**
    - Explore updated tutorials and interactive examples

---

### 3. Core Angular Concepts

- **Standard Components:**
    - **Standalone Components:** In Angular v19, components, directives, and pipes are now standalone by default. This allows you to avoid the module system and simplifies the project structure.
    - Lifecycle hooks (ngOnInit, ngOnDestroy), data exchange (Input, Output)
- **Directives and Pipes:**
    - Built-in directives such as *ngIf, *ngFor, ngClass, and ngStyle
    - Creating custom directives and pipes

---

### 4. Angular v19 New Features and Modern Approaches

- **Reactivity and Signals:**
    - Angular Signals concept and new reactive primitives (e.g., linkedSignal)
    - Managing inputs and queries using signal-based APIs
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Hydration:**
    - Incremental hydration: Using the familiar @defer syntax to lazily load parts of the template
    - Zoneless change detection: Reducing reliance on zone.js and simplifying the SSR process
    - Event replay: Automatically replaying user events in SSR-rendered pages
- **Router and Lazy Loading:**
    - Route-level render mode to control rendering on the server or client
    - Lazy loading to save resources

---

### 5. RxJS and State Management

- **Observables and RxJS:**
    - Managing asynchronous data streams and using operators (map, filter, mergeMap, debounceTime, catchError)
- **State Management:**
    - Handling application state using Angular’s built-in features or libraries such as NgRx/NGXS

---

### 6. Forms

- **Template-Driven and Reactive (Model-Driven) Forms:**
    - Using ngModel, FormControl, FormGroup, Validators
    - Handling validation and errors in forms

---

### 7. Routing and Navigation

- **Angular Router:**
    - Defining routes, using router-outlet, and accessing route parameters with ActivatedRoute
    - Implementing lazy loading and dynamic routes; managing server routes (an Angular v19 update)

---

### 8. Testing and Code Quality

- **Unit and Integration Testing:**
    - Using Jasmine, Karma, or experimental testing libraries (Jest, Web Test Runner)
- **Coding Standards and Linting:**
    - Following the Angular Style Guide, using TSLint/ESLint, and Prettier
- **Angular Language Service:**
    - Enabling autocompletion and error detection while coding

---

### 9. Version Control and DevOps

- **Git and GitHub:**
    - Version control, managing branches, merges, and pull requests
- **CI/CD:**
    - Automating builds, tests, and deployments

---

### 10. Soft Skills and Real Projects

- **Communication and Teamwork:**
    - Engaging with Angular communities (Stack Overflow, Discord, Angular Forum)
- **Practical Projects:**
    - Building portfolio projects such as simple CRUD apps, Single-Page Applications (SPAs), and SSR-based applications
- **Staying Updated:**
    - Regularly checking angular.dev for the latest interactive tutorials, examples, and practical guides

---

### Conclusion

The key new features of Angular v19—such as standalone components, incremental hydration, zoneless SSR, and reactive signals—create fresh opportunities for efficient, modern web development. This roadmap provides the essential knowledge and skills needed to build scalable web applications using Angular v19. Regularly following angular.dev and working on real projects will further strengthen your expertise as a junior Angular developer.
